			You can press the slash key to show and hide a command box. With this box, you can toggle debug-only preferences by entering a preference and pressing Enter:
			<br><br>
			"visionCone" (shows what creatures can see) <br>
			"hearingRange" (shows what creatures can hear) <br>
			"senseArea" (shows box being checked for other creatures) <br>
			"hitboxGrid" (shows a representation of the hitboxes) <br>
			"showId" (shows creature IDs as floating text) <br>
			"showState" (shows creature states) <br>
			"drawPath" (shows what paths creatures are following) <br>
			"drawRelations" (draws lines between creatures representing their attitudes to each other)
			<br><br>
			Example usage: <br>
			<b>/showId</b> <br>
			<b>drawPath</b> <br><br>
			Note that these are case-sensitive. The slash doesn't matter; you can remove it.
