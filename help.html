			You can press the slash key to show and hide a command box. Within this box, you can toggle debug-only preferences:
			<br>
			"visionCone" (shows what creatures can see)
			"hearingRange" (shows what creatures can hear)
			"senseArea" (shows box being checked for other creatures)
			"hitboxGrid" (shows a representation of the hitboxes)
			"showId" (shows creature IDs as floating text)
			"showState" (shows creature states)
			"drawPath" (shows what paths creatures are following)
			"drawRelations" (draws lines between creatures representing their attitudes to each other)
			<br><br>
			Example usage: <br>
			<b>/showId</b> <br>
			<b>drawPath</b> <br><br>
			Note that these are case-sensitive. The slash doesn't matter; you can remove it.
