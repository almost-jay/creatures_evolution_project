		<p><b>Right mouse button</b> to pan.<br>
		<b>Left mouse button</b> to use a tool.<br>
		Hold the <b>backtick key</b> or <b>middle mouse button</b> to open the tool selection menu.<br>
		Release the mouse while hovering over the desired tool to select it, or press the arrow keys. Tools are: <br>
		<b>Drag tool</b> - drag things around.
		<b>Inspect tool</b> - click on a creature to see information about it.
		<b>Food tool</b> - click to place food.
		<b>Editor tool</b> - add creatures with custom properties.

	<li><a id="#bugs"><i><b>Help! I found a bug!</b></i></a>
		<p>If possible, get a screenshot of it, and send it to me with a detailed description of how you triggered it or what you were doing when it happened.</p>

			You can press the slash key to show and hide a command box. Within this box, you can toggle debug-only preferences:
			<br>
			"visionCone" (shows what creatures can see)
			"hearingRange" (shows what creatures can hear)
			"senseArea" (shows box being checked for other creatures)
			"hitboxGrid" (shows a representation of the hitboxes)
			"showId" (shows creature IDs as floating text)
			"showState" (shows creature states)
			"drawPath" (shows what paths creatures are following)
			"drawRelations" (draws lines between creatures representing their attitudes to each other)
			<br><br>
			Example usage: <br>
			<b>/showId</b> <br>
			<b>drawPath</b> <br><br>
			Note that these are case-sensitive. The slash doesn't matter; you can remove it.

	<li><a id="#info"><i><b>Code information</b></i></a>
		<p>
			This is going to be long. <br>

			This was written in TypeScript in Visual Studio Code. It uses the Electron framework. Version numbers are my own system, intended merely to convey the approximate number of bugs fixed/features added between each release. <br>
			The canvas is the HTML5 canvas; I could've used WebGL but chose not to in favour of simplicity.
		</p>
	
	<li><a id="#info"><i><b>Maths information</b></i></a>
		<p>
			This is completely procedurally generated, so there was a lot of maths involved. The biggest equations were the movement and the inverse kinematics systems.
			<br><br>
			There will be a writeup here later.
